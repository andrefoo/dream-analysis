(Trucking Liability Coverage)\n\nFrom: Susan Lee, Risk Advisor, Elite Insurance Partners\nTo: Mark Davis, Senior Underwriter, Pioneer Casualty Insurance\n\nHi Mark,\n\nI have a challenging account for LMN Logistics, Inc., a regional trucking company with 25 trucks and three claims over the last five years, including a major collision 18 months ago. The client has since improved risk management and seeks a $1M Commercial Auto Liability and $3M Excess Liability quote. We need indications by next Friday for renewal.\n\nImprovements include a new driver safety program, stricter hiring standards, and telematics in all vehicles. The client is open to higher deductibles or self-insured retentions. I appreciate your consideration and am available to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\nSusan Lee\nRisk Advisor, Elite Insurance Partners\nCell: (555) 456-7890 | Office: (555) 456-7800 ext. 101\nEmail: slee@eliteinsure.com",
