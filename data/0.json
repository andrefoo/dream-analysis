I'm reaching out on behalf of Luca Transportation, a client of ours that operates in the agricultural sector, specifically transporting feed and grain from manufacturers to farmers. They have 20 commercial vehicles in their fleet and are looking for at least $1 million in liability coverage to meet both their contractual obligations and industry standards.\n\nIf there are any additional coverage options or endorsements (especially those tailored to agricultural transport) that you'd recommend, I'd love to discuss them. Please let me know if there's any specific information or documentation you need to get started. I appreciate your help in putting this quote together and look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Smith\nABC Insurance Brokers\njsmith@abcinsurance.com",
