I'm reaching out with an urgent quote request for XYZ Manufacturing Inc., which needs liability coverage exceeding standard limits. The client is requesting a $10 million general liability limit, exceeding your usual $5 million capacity. Their operations involve manufacturing industrial equipment, and they have a large contract pending that requires higher coverage. The current policy expires in two days, so we urgently need a quote by end of day tomorrow.\n\nI understand this request exceeds your underwriting limits and appreciate any special consideration. Would you consider a layered program or obtaining approval from higher authority to accommodate the $10M limit? We're open to alternative structures (e.g., a $5M primary with an excess policy). XYZ Manufacturing is a reputable firm with strong risk management practices, and I believe this could be a valuable account for Reliable Insurance.\n\nThank you for fast-tracking this request. Let me know if you need any additional information. I appreciate your help and look forward to your response.\n\nSincerely,\nJane Smith\nSenior Commercial Broker, ABC Insurance Brokers\nPhone: (555) 123-4567 | Email: jsmith@abcinsurance.com",
